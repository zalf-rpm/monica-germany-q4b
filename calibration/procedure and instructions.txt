STEPS TO RUN A CALIBRATION:

1) DUMP THE PROPER MONICA ENVS
launch "run-work-producer.py" with DUMP_ENVS_CALIB=true and USER_MODE="localProducer-remoteMonica". The latter customizes the envs for the cluster runs. Check that CONFIGURATION["run-setups"] corresponds to the setup desired. The list of setups can be found and extended in the file monica-data\projects\monica-germany\sim_setups.csv

2) CHECK THE FILE "calibration_log.csv"
this file contains the list of the previous calibrations. The list can be extended with new ones. The fields relevant for the calibrator are:

- clustering_file: used to inform the calibrator about possible clustering of the landkreise. Each cluster will be calibrated independently from the others

- run_cells_file: contains the information about the cells sampled for the calibration. only cells marked with "use-it"=y will be used. This is to allow for quick tests using subsets of cells

- calibration_target: defines the target variable. Three options are supported for this study: sowing, phenology and yield. The calibrator will lookup the data needed in the "cleaned_pheno" or "yields" files in the folder monica-data\projects\monica-germany

- params_to_calibrate: holds the information about the parameters under calibration

- crop: either "winter_wheat" or "silage_maize"

- dumped_envs_folder: where to look for the envs to run the simulations (see point 1)

- rep: number of repetitions for the ROPE algorithm

3) CHECK AND RUN "sampler_MONICA.py"
set the calib_id to run a specific calibration

ADDITIONAL SUPPORTING SCRIPTS:
"write_all_lks_no_clustering" will take all the run cells marked with "use-it"=y and list them as part of a single cluster in an output file. Options for clusters made of 1 lk was added (one_lk_per_cluster = True). I/O file names have to be specified in the code

"obs_vs_sim/calculate_indices" will calculate some indices at the lk level (plus all the lks together). Input file name has to be specified
